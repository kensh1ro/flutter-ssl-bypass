### tested on linux
## i will assume that you already have burp's certificate installed to system CA store, if not then follow along ðŸ¤¦

ATTENTION: this needs a rooted devices

after exporting Burp's DER certificate, we need to change it PEM format, although this isn't necessary, but it seems that Android CA store doesn't like DER format

`openssl x509 -inform der -in $CERT_NAME -out certificate.pem`
`openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in certificate.pem | head -1` #my output was 9a5ba575

rename "certificate.pem" to the above command's output, for example:
`mv certificate.pem 9a5ba575.0`

now make sure you have an ADB connection to your device

`adb push 9a5ba575.0 /sdcard
adb shell mount -o rw,remount /system
cp /sdcard/9a5ba575.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts
chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0
chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/9a5ba575.0`

after that you should REBOOT!

**i will demonstrate by example to make the method easier to apply**

You will need:
- Android device (rooted physical phone preferred)
- a PC with linux installed
- a brain ;)

lets assume that our android device has the IP address 192.168.1.7
and linux PC got 192.168.1.9

## 1) **First step is to add the linux PC as a gateway for our Android device**

## 2) **Second step is to forward http/https traffic to Burp Suite**

`iptables -i wlan0 -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j REDIRECT --dport 443 --to-ports 8080`

NOTE: you can also add a redirect for port 80 to 8080 by chaning `--dport 443 to --dport 80`


## 3) **Third step is to let Burp Suite capture the forwarded traffic**
make sure to enable invisible proxying
and for HTTPS, enable force use of TLS

as a temporary address, i have added google.com but after knowing where the traffic is headed, you can change "Redirect to host" value to the proper address that is meant to be forwarded.

also you might want to listen on all interfaces, to avoid ip configuration hastle

at the end it should look something like this (pay attention to the User Agent):
