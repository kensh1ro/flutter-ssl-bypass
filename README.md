# flutter-ssl-bypass

### tested on linux
## i will assume that you already have burp's certificate installed to system CA store

**i will demonstrate by example to make the method easier to apply**

You will need:
- Android device (rooted physical phone preferred)
- a PC with linux installed
- a brain ;)

lets assume that our android device has the IP address 192.168.1.7
and linux PC got 192.168.1.9

## 1) **First step is to add the linux PC as a gateway for our Android device**


## 2) **Second step is to forward http/https traffic to Burp Suite**


## 3) **Third step is to let Burp Suite capture the forwarded traffic**
